## Hi, I'm Moises ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm an AWS-certified Software Engineer with a focus on Python, Java, and Go backend development, Linux, and automation tools.

I have decided to capitalize on my extensive experience triaging, troubleshooting, and resolving, technical issues, in a career pivot toward software development and cloud infrastructure. I wrapped up a 12-week batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in September 2023 where I focused on leveling up my Python skills through projects. Projects included GUI games, integrating third-party APIs to solve practical problems, Flask back-end projects, and RESTFul APIs using SQLAlchemy.

While at Recurse I contributed to a group project that built a multiplayer quiz web app developed using Flask, WebSockets, Python, and JavaScript, and made use of Git for version control and GitHub issues to organize tasks. I deployed to AWS using Ansible and Docker containers. I'm currently completing a software engineering apprenticeship with [Hack.Diversity](https://www.hackdiversity.com/) as a 2025 fellow dedicated to breaking down barriers in the tech economy by completing a career development program focused on professional skills development, technical team projects, and industry exposure.
