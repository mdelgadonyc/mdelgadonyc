## Hi, I'm Moises ðŸ‘‹

I graduated with a bachelor's degree from the City University of New York (CUNY). I have a lot of work experience triaging, troubleshooting, and resolving, technical issues, which I have decided to use in my career pivot towards software development and cloud infrastructure. I wrapped up a 12-week batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in September 2023 where I focused on leveling up my Python skills through small projects. Projects included GUI games, integrating third party APIs to solve practical problems, Flask back-end projects, and RESTFul APIs using SQLAlchemy.

While at Recurse I contributed to a group project that built a multiplayer quiz web app developed using Flask, websockets, Python, JavaScript, and made use of Git for version control and GitHub issues to organize tasks. I deployed to AWS using Ansible and Docker containers.
